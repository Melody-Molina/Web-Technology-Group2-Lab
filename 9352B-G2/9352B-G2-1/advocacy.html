	<h1>What is Solid waste management?</h1>

	    <p class="index-text-envi">Solid waste management is a process of collecting, treating, and disposing of solid waste that is discarded and no longer needed. Improper disposal can create unsanitary conditions that lead to pollution of the environment and out breaks of diseases. This waste comes from homes, offices, industries, and other agricultural related activities. Improper disposal can pollute the surrounding air and can affect the health of humans, wildlife and most especially our Environment. Proper solid waste management is an integral part of environmental conservation that should be observed by individuals with this we can keep the “Environment clean” and reduce health and settlement problems. <br><br>

        “FOR A BETTER ENVIRONMENT, SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT MUST START FROM OUR HOMES”</p>

    
    <h2>What are the basic method to manage solid waste ?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Landfills – this process of waste disposal focuses attention on burying the waste in the land. There is a process used to eliminates the odors of waste before placing it into the ground, this process are commonly found in developing countries. Landfills give rise to air and water pollution which severely affects the environment and lives og humans and animals. Many areas are reconsidering the use of landfills.</li>
        <li>Recycling – this process of converting waste products into new products to prevent energy usage and consumption of fresh raw materials. Recycling is the third component of “Reduce, Reuse and Recycle”. The idea behind this process is to reduce energy usage, reduce volume landfills, reduce air pollution, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and preserve natural resources for future generation. </li>
        <li>Composting –  this process easy and natural degradation process that takes organic wastes. Composting ,normally used for organic farming, occurs by allowing organic materials to sit in one place for months until microbes decompose it. So far, this method is one of the best way to manage waste disposal, it can turn unsafe organic products into safe compost but it is slow process and takes lot of space.</li>
    </ol>
