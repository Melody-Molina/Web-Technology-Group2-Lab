<h1>Coordination with barangays key to tackling land use issues</h1>
<p>There must be closer coordination among the barangays, the local government and various government agencies in solving the city’s land use problems.

This was the consensus during the forum conducted by the committee on urban planning, lands, and housing on Dec. 15, 2017.

It was agreed during the forum that while agencies and the local government departments have specific mandates, barangay officials must directly coordinate with the concerned departments and the city council regarding their concerns on land use and urban planning.

Issues raised in Fairview include constricted roads, no sidewalks and alleged illegal cutting of trees.</p>
