	<h2>Environmental Protection</h2>
	<i><p>"We’re living on the same planet. We are living on the same environment. And we, human, are not the only one live in this environment. 
	We can’t live on our own without our natural resources which gives us food and anything that human can not provide on their own.</p>
	<p>Before everything is too late let us protect and save our environment. 
Let the next generations see the beauty and importance of our environment. 
Let them experience the environment that we lived for how many years.</p>
Support our Environmental Protection!"
