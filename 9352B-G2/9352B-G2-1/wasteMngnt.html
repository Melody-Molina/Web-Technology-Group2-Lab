	<h2>“Ecological Solid Waste Management Act: Environmental Protection through Proper Solid Waste” <h2>
	
	<p> Waste mismanagement has serious environmental effects on the environment that is why the government
		crafted  a law in response to the looming garbage problems in the country. The law declares the policy 
		of the state in adopting a systematic, comprehensive and ecological solid waste management program that 
		ensures the protection of public health and the environment and the proper segregation, collection, 
		transport, storage, treatment and disposal of solid waste through the formulation and adoption of best 
		environmental practices. Moreover, it illustrates the potentials and benefits of recycling not only in 
		addressing waste management problems but also in alleviating poverty. </p>
		
	<p> Human activities contribute significantly in waste management. 
	Recognizing the effects of improper management, garbage crisis can be
	prevented by practicing waste characterization and segregation 
	at source, proper collection and transfer, recycling, and composting 
	as mandated by the law. </p>
